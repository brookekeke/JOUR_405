Activity #1: Activity: M&Ms - Central Limit Theorem

Working in groups, each group will get a handful of candy from the bag, and then count the number of red and black candies. Log those in this Google Sheet 

https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1KOeoVTq2W7L2T9sWjwh5U_2f59GsTeAylVGD53rNWww/edit?usp=sharing

(give your group a nice name).

Take a look at the values that we all get - what do you notice about the patterns? This is an exercise about the central limit theorem. 

The central limit theorem states that the sampling distribution of the mean of any independent, random variable will be normal or nearly normal, if the sample size is large enough.

Then discuss and try to answer these questions:

--How close is your group's mean to the true proportion of 0.5?
--Why do different groups get different results?
--What happens to individual extreme results when we combine all groups?
--How does this relate to polls and surveys in real life?

Write your answer below. And then you may eat the M&Ms.

**A:**

Our group's mean for colored M%Ms is far off from the true proportion of 0.5 since we got 92.45%. The groups got different results because everyone had a different randomly selected sample size. It will be more of a normal distribution if all groups were combined. This relates to polls and surveys in real life since the samples weren't evenly distributed and a larger sample size was needed to get a more accurate result.

# Activity #2:

Belonging Survey

Working in pairs, take a look back at the main findings fromÂ UMD's Belonging Survey:

https://president.umd.edu/internal/belonging


Specifically, focus on the "Sample Description" section and the Appendix. Discuss the differences and between the population and the sample, and what the document says about how the survey attempted to deal with them. Are there any decisions described in the document that raise questions in your minds? Detail the differences you see and your understanding of the methods they employed (it's ok if you don't understand all of them), and add your questions. You should discuss this as a pair but submit individually.

**A:**

The overall population is over 53,000, however only over 12,000 community members responded to the survey. The population is much larger than the sample size so the data doesn't reflect the larger population. Men were underrepresented while women were over represented.

# TASK 3: SAMPLING

Based on the class sampling demo (available on Elms), sample data from a population using R and the Tidyverse. You should get started by loading the tidyverse in a new R block.

### Task 1: Load the tidyverse

**A**
```{r}
library(tidyverse)
library(dplyr)

```


### Task 2: Load 1,000 rows of data with the ages of people from 18-80

**A**
```{r}

set.seed(42)
younguns <- tibble(
  age = sample(18:80, 1000, replace = TRUE))

head(younguns)

```

### Task 3: Sample 100 rows of data from the dataset
**A**
```{r}
sample_100 <-younguns |> 
  sample_n(100)

sample_20 <-younguns |> 
  sample_n(20)

```


### Task 4: Calculate the mean age and standard deviation of the sample
**A**
```{r}
sample_100 |> summarize(mean = mean(age), median = median(age), sd = sd(age)) 
sample_20 |> summarize(mean = mean(age), median = median(age), sd = sd(age))


```


### Task 5: Calculate the mean age and standard deviation of the population
**A**
```{r}
younguns |> summarize(mean = mean(age), median = median(age), sd = sd(age))


```


### Task 6: Compare the sample and population statistics

Compare the means and standard deviations. Are they similar? Go back and re-run the sampling and statistics calculations with a smaller sample size. How do the results change?

**A**: 

The means and standard deviation are similar for both the sample and the population. After re-running the calculations with a smaller sample size, the mean, median and standard deviation are all significantly lower than both the sample size of 100 and the population. 

When finished, save your work, switch to GitHub Desktop, then add, commit and push your changes to GitHub and submit the URL of the notebook in ELMS.
